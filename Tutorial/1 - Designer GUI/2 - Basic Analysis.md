Basic Analysis
---

For this tutorial we will run a basic analysis on the default Boeing 737-800 Configuration. Launch the WUADS gui and do
not change anything from the default configuration. Navigate to the "Analysis" tab in the bottom left. This is where we 
will run our basic analysis.

From this screen, select weights analysis. Select where you want your weights analysis to be saved and give it a name and 
select "Ok". The weights analysis results will pop up on WUADS, but for a clearer view you can open the file itself.
This weights file gives a detailed breakdown of the overall weight of the aircraft, the center of gravity, and each
component's weights. A copy of this output is included in file 2a.

Similarly, a mission profile report can be generated by selecting "Mission Profile Analysis". This analysis will analyze
the plane's performance at a number of points over the given mission profile and give an estimate for the total fuel
burned. To see or edit the mission profile being analyzed, check the "Mission Profile" tab. The default output for this
analysis is included in file 2b.
